The Fourier-based-demand-estimation approach contains two phases. In the first phase, we use an active learning algorithm to 
identify all Fourier bases whose L1 norm are big enough and turn them into trees. In the second phases, we sample more trees 
uniformly and combine then with the list of trees obtained in the first phase. Then we run a simple linear regression problem on those 
trees to solve their coefficients. 

We mainly want to improve upon the RTS method in the DF paper. The paper proposes two methods. The first method is calld HCG
(heuristic column generation), for which there is no theoretical guarantee. The second method is called RTS(randomized tree sampling). 
For this method, they first sample a large number of trees from a distribution P (often the uniform distribution) and then identify the 
coefficient of those trees. The paper shows that the error of the prediction scales with the discrepancy between P and the acutal 
distribution of trees. In particular, when P is uniform, the method may fail to recover those trees with large coefficients. We resolve 
this issue by first using an active learning algorithm to identity those significant trees. 

The following methods and classes will be implemented. 

1. trees
standard trees with a few extra features. 
need to ensure that a product never appears two times in a path. 
need to ensure that the final choice selected at the leaf node must have appear before in the path. 

evaluate: input is the choice set. At the current node, if node i is present, go to left; otherwise go to right. When at leaf node l, 
output l if l is present. Otherwise output 0 i.e. no buy. 
revenue: multiplying price with the result of evaluate. 


2. forests
a collection of trees T. Each tree t has a probability p_t. 
evaluate: simply summing the result of every individual tree. 
revenue: same as above

We also need a method to generate random trees.
