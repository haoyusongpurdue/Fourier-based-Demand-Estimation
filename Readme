The Fourier-based-demand-estimation approach contains two phases. In the first phase, we use an active learning algorithm to 
identify all Fourier bases whose L1 norm are big enough and turn them into trees. In the second phases, we sample more trees 
uniformly and combine then with the list of trees obtained in the first phase. Then we run a linear regression problem on those 
trees to solve their coefficients.
